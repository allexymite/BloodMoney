WARNING: this software is a work in progress and is REALLY BUGGY right now. About half of webpages will spit their source code at you instead of loading if you run this extension (though it's very easy to fix it--just turn it off in chrome://extensions).
<br/>A Chrome extension that converts currency to opportunity cost, as per www.raikoth.net/deadchild.html
